           The mission of this course is to teach students how to build computer 
           systems that can be trusted in situations where the system�s response to 
           external events must be both timely and accurate. An important class of such systems 
           is the systems involved to control physical processes. Students will be taught how conventional 
           (analog) control systems can be implemented by software running on digital computers. 
           Real-time operating systems will be discussed and students will learn how to write drivers 
           for the Linux kernel using RTAI (Real Time Application Interface). They will also be introduced 
           to the task model and some real-time scheduling algorithms. Specification and design of real-time 
           systems will also be discussed.

      <assessment>
        <description>There will be weekly assignments (11 in total); your assignment mark will consist of the best five of these. There will be no extensions for assignment due dates.
 For those taking the course at the 600-level, there will be an extra project involving a project to be mutually agreed on (please see the instructor at your earliest convenience. The marking scheme for graduate students will have the project worth 15%, the labs 10% and the exam 35% (the remaining components stay the same).
 For those taking the Advanced Credit Option towards an M.Eng. degree, please note that your mark for 4AA4 will be computed according to the marking scheme for 4AA4. You must also complete the graduate component that 600-level students do (this is the Advanced Credit component). This will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis and has no bearing on the mark for 4AA4.</description>
