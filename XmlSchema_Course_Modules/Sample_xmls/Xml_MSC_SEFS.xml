    <description>
         This module is an introduction to the technical and organisational aspects 
          of systems engineering, focusing on early lifecycle systems analysis 
          and modelling (i.e. systems concepts, requirements and architectures). 
          It intends to present systems engineering principles which are applicable 
          to a range of critical engineering systems (e.g. control systems, platforms, 
          systems of systems and autonomous and configurable systems). 
          In particular, it focuses on the early consideration of, and tradeoffs between, 
          technical as well as economic attributes such as safety, maintainability, 
          cost and time-to-market in the context of key organisational challenges related to 
          technology readiness and process maturity.
