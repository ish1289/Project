        <h3>Pre-requisites:-</h3>
        <li>Basic Knowledge of safety terminology either through Foundations of System Safety Engineering (FSSE) module or demonstration of equivalent knowledge 
        through industrial experience / previous education. </li>

        <h3>Course Description:-</h3>
        This module teaches systematic approaches to hazard identification and risk assessment,
        including principles of risk reduction and ALARP. It effectively covers the first half of
        the safety process in the system development lifecycle. It encompasses predictive,
        target-setting techniques and should ideally be taken as a pair with System Safety Assessment,
        which addresses concepts and techniques appropriate to the later stages of a development project.

        <h3>Learning Outcomes:-</h3>
        <li>An understanding of the principles of hazard identification and assessment</li>
        <li>An initial ability to apply techniques such as Functional Failure Analysis and HAZOP</li>
        <li>An understanding of approaches to risk reduction</li>
        <li>An appreciation of common cause / common mode failure mechanisms, and their importance</li>
        <h3>Workload:-</h3>
        <b>Total Lecture Hours:- </b>14<br/>
        <b>Each Lecture Duration:- </b>1 hour and 30 mins<br/>
        <b>Total Practice Hours:- </b>8 hours<br/>
        <b>Total Private Study Time:- </b>30 Hours<br/>
        <b>Assessment Time:- </b>35hrs<br/>
        <b>Description:- </b>
        The teaching is organised in one intense week of lectures and case studies (practicals)
        Students should expect to undertake about 65 hours of private study. This is divided 
        as approximately 30 hours private study 
        time and 35 hours writing response to assessment questions.
