        <b>School:- </b>Ryerson University<br/>
        <b>Year:- </b>2013<br/>
        <h3>Course Description:-</h3>
      This course will introduce and explore the programming language and operating system 
      facilities essential to the implementation of real-time, reactive, embedded, robotic 
      and/or networked systems. It will provide practical knowledge of the system issues which must 
      be addressed from design and programming perspective. Differentiated issues arising from design, 
      concurrent, reactive, safety-critical and embedded systems will be explored in depth. 
      Simple hands-on development is facilitated with an embedded system development kit.
      <br/>
