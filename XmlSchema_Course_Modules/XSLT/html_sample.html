        <h3>Pre-requisites:-</h3>
        <li>A basic understanding of safety principles would be good but not essential. 
      Please check with the module owner if you are unsure of your experience.</li>
        <h3>Course Description:- </h3>
      This module is an introduction to the principles of system safety, including risk, 
      basic terminology, and the main types of hazard and safety assessment techniques. 
      It also provides a brief overview of material which will be covered in greater depth in later modules, 
      such as legal issues, management of safety critical projects, and human factors.
