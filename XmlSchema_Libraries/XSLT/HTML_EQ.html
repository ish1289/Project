        <h3>Overview:-</h3>
        The PIC32 Audio Equalizer (EQ) Filter Library is specifically designed to assist with multiple-frequency filtering of digital audio. 
        The library can work from multiple audio sources, and customize the listening experience to compensate for speaker, room / enclosure acoustics or user preferences. The library can
        support either graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer filtering functions.
        An optional element of graphical frequency-band magnitude is also available to enable a real-time display of the audio output.

        <b>Audio Equalizer Filtering Library</b>
        <br/>
          In music playback, digital filtering can be performed before digital bits are converted into analog
          voltages that are
          played by speakers to maintain high fidelity audio as shown in the figure 1 above.
          An audio equalizer filtering library performs various tasks including digital filtering to
          correct deficits in the recorded music, mitigate problems in the speakers being used, or
          simply correct for the room's acoustics - all focused on improving the user's experience of the music.
          The library provides filtering primitives for audio equalization using infinite impulse response (IIR)
          filters. It supports filter architectures for traditional graphical equalization and for parametric
          equalization.
          1) Parametric Equalizer Filters - Serial sequence of IIR filters from 2-20 biquads, 
          Typically runs peaking and shelving filter designs, 
          Used for factory tuning of speaker and enclosure / environmental harmonics,
          2) Graphic Equalizer Filters - Parallel architecture of filters, 2 biquad filters per band, 
          summed for a single output, 4-16 frequency bands can be supported, Typically runs band-pass filter designs,
          Used for user preference filtering and real-time gain adjustment per frequency band

        <b>Graphic Equalizer Display Library</b>
        <br/>
          The Graphic Equalizer Display Library works on any Microchip device that drives
          an LCD display, providing Graphic Equalizer displays for the host application.
          Graphic Equalizers are used to adjust the spectral content of music by providing gain or
          attenuation to parts of the music based on frequency. This library works hand-in-hand with
          the Audio Equalizer Filtering Library, which does the actual signal processing (filtering).
          The Graphic Equalizer Display Library is an adjunct of the Audio Equalizer Filtering Library in 
          that it supports displaying information produced by routines in the filtering library, 
          namely signal strength as measured by the filtering library. It also supports displaying band 
          filter gains so that the user can adjust filter gains as part of a Graphic Equalizer display.
