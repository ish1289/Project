        <h3>Overview:-</h3>
        The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and 
        iterators; it provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science. 
        The STL is a generic library, meaning that its components are heavily parameterized: almost every 
        component in the STL is a template. You should make sure that you 
        understand how templates work in C++ before you use the STL.

        <b>Containers and algorithms</b>
        <br/>
          Like many class libraries, the STL includes container classes: classes whose purpose is to contain other objects. The STL includes the classes vector, list, deque, set, multiset, map, multimap, hash_set, hash_multiset, hash_map, and hash_multimap. Each of these classes is a template, and can be instantiated to contain any type of object. You can, for example, use a vector int in much the same way as you would use an ordinary C array, except that vector eliminates the chore of managing dynamic memory allocation by hand.
        The STL also includes a large collection of algorithms that manipulate the data stored in containers. You can reverse the order of elements in a vector, for example, by using the reverse algorithm.

        <b>Iterators</b>
        <br/>
          Iterators are the mechanism that makes it possible to decouple algorithms from containers: 
          algorithms are templates, and are parameterized by the type of iterator, so they are not restricted 
          to a single type of container. Consider, for example, how to write an algorithm that performs linear 
          search through a range. This is the STL's find algorithm.

        <b>Concepts and Modeling</b>
        <br/>Concepts are not a part of the C++ language; there is no way to declare 
        a concept in a program, or to declare that a particular type is a model of a concept. 
        Nevertheless, concepts are an extremely important part of the STL. Using concepts makes it possible 
        to write programs that cleanly separate interface from implementation: the author of find only has to 
        consider the interface specified by the concept Input Iterator, rather than the implementation of every 
        possible type that conforms to that concept. Similarly, if you want to use find, you need only to ensure 
        that the arguments you pass to it are models of Input Iterator. This is the reason why find and reverse 
        can be used with lists, vectors, C arrays, and many other types: programming in terms of concepts, rather 
        than in terms of specific types, makes it possible to reuse software components and to combine components 
        together.<br/>

        <b>Refinement</b>
        <br/>
          The Bidirectional Iterator concept is very similar to the Input Iterator concept: it simply imposes some additional requirements. The types that are models of Bidirectional Iterator are a subset of the types that are models of Input Iterator: every type that is a model of Bidirectional Iterator is also a model of Input Iterator. Int*, for example, is both a model of Bidirectional Iterator and a model of Input Iterator, but istream_iterator, is only a model of Input Iterator: it does not
          conform to the more stringent Bidirectional Iterator requirements. We describe the relationship between Input Iterator and Bidirectional Iterator by saying that Bidirectional Iterator is a refinement of Input Iterator. Refinement of concepts is very much like inheritance of C++ classes; the main reason we use a different word, instead of just calling it "inheritance", is to emphasize that refinement applies to concepts rather than to actual types.
          There are actually three more iterator concepts in addition to the two that we have already discussed: the five iterator concepts are Output Iterator, Input Iterator, Forward Iterator, Bidirectional Iterator, and Random Access Iterator; Forward Iterator is a refinement of Input Iterator, Bidirectional Iterator is a refinement of Forward Iterator, and Random Access Iterator is a refinement of Bidirectional Iterator. (Output Iterator is related to the other four concepts, but it is not part of the hierarchy of refinement: it is not a refinement of any of the other iterator concepts, and none of the other iterator concepts are refinements of it.) The Iterator Overview has more information about iterators in general.
          Container classes, like iterators, are organized into a hierarchy of concepts. All containers are models of the concept Container; more refined concepts, such as Sequence and Associative Container, describe specific types of containers.

        <b>Other parts of the STL</b>
        <br/>
          First, the STL includes several utilities: very basic concepts and functions that are used in many different parts of the library. The concept Assignable, for example, describes types that have assignment operators and copy constructors; almost all STL classes are models of Assignable,
          and almost all STL algorithms require their arguments to be models of Assignable.
          Second, the STL includes some low-level mechanisms for allocating and deallocating memory. Allocators are very specialized, and you can safely ignore them for almost all purposes.
          Finally, the STL includes a large collection of function objects, also known as functors. Just as iterators are a generalization of pointers, function objects are a generalization of functions: a function object is anything that you can call using the ordinary function call syntax. There are several different concepts relating to function objects, including Unary Function (a function object that takes a single argument, i.e. one that is called as f(x)) and Binary Function (a function object that takes two arguments, i.e. one that is called as f(x, y)). Function objects are an important part of generic programming because they allow abstraction not only over the types of objects, but also over the operations that are being performed.
