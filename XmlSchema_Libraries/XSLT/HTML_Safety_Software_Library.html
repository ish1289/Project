        <h3>Overview:-</h3>
        With the exponential rise of automatic electronic control in household appliances the need for 
        reliability and safety of operation is a concern. For this reason the International Electrotechnical 
        Commission introduced the IEC60730 standard, which requires that household appliances with automatic 
        electronic control to be evaluated from the point of view of consumer and application safety. 
        The Class B software classification of IEC60730 is required to have functions that are intended to 
        prevent unsafe operation of wide range of appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, dryers, 
        refrigerators, freezers and cookers/stoves.

        <b>Contents-</b>
        <br/>Microchip provides the Class B Safety Software Library for its 16-bit and PIC32 MCUs which can
        overcome the safety critical failures and is in accordance with the IEC 60730 standard to support
        the Class B certification process. The Class B Safety Software Library implements the important test
        and diagnostic methods that fall into the Class B category. These methods use various measures to
        detect and respond to the software related faults and errors. The Class B Safety Software routines can
        be called periodically at start-up or run time to test the following components: 
        CPU Registers,CPU Program Counter,Invariable Memory, Variable Memory, Clock, Interrupt Handling and Execution
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition there are different API’s that are available in the Class B Safety Software 
        Library which can be used to directly integrate with the end user’s application to test 
        and verify the critical functionalities of a controller and are intended to maximize the 
        application reliability through Fault detection. When implemented on a 16-bit or PIC32 MCU 
        microcontroller, these APIs help meet the IEC 60730 standard’s requirements.
      <br/>
        <br/>
        Microchips’ offering of Class B Safety Software Library to appliance manufacturers who 
        are obligated to comply with Class B of IEC 60730 is one instance which exemplifies its 
        commitment to customer satisfaction. It provides the players of cost sensitive white goods 
        market an additional value by cutting down their time to 
        market and cost to obtain product certification.
