This file demonstrates a problem I am having in attempting to utilize
the "chameleon" effect.  At the top level I have a schema w/ a
targetNamespace.  At lower levels are schemas that get reused by
toplevel schemas having potentially different namespaces.  So the
lower level schemas are "Chameleon components" which have no target
namespace.  In these lower level schemas, like this one, I would like
to be able to define things in terms of other things defined in this
file.  And since I don't know the namespace this file will eventually
take on, I would like to avoid having to qualify any references in
this file w/ a namespace (outside of the "xsd" and "xml" namespaces,
of course).  Unfortunately, xerces-1.4.x (2 or 3) won't let me do
this.  I'm not sure if this is a bug in xerces or is a problem w/ the
spec itself, or whether I'm simply trying to do something that is
impossible.  In checking my desired schema against IBM Alphaworks'
Schema Quality Checker or Thompson and Tobin's xsv, it does OK-that is
it passes.  But against xerces it fails.

This file is my desired schema.  However it does not pass muster with
xerces tho it does w/ both SQC (Schema Quality Checker Version
1.2.004) and xsv 1.197/1.101.
