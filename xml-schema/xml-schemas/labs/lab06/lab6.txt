Lab 6. Using Derived Types

Modify the schema that you created in Lab 5.
Create a type called appliance.  Define
appliance to contain declarations for description
and warranty.  Create a type called juiceAppliance,
which is derived from appliance (by extension).  Make juicer
of type juiceAppliance.  As always, validate the instance 
document against your schema.

Note: You will need to rearrange the contents of each juicer
in the instance document!
