Lab 11.c Using Multiple Namespaces

For this lab you are to modify the juicers.xml and the schemas
that you created in lab 11.a.

Put Appliances.xsd schema in its own namespace (http://www.appliances.org).  
Modify juicers.xsd to use the appliances complexType, which
is now in a different namespace.  You will need to modify
the instance document to reflect the fact that it is using
multiple namespaces.
