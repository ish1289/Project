Lab 12.1 Making the Juicer Information Net-Centric

Up till now the juicers data was all in one, monolithic XML document.
This is not net-centricity!

I have split up the data.  Now there is an XML document for each juicer.

You are to:

1. Create juicers.xml
      - this XML document should be designed to link to each juicer document
        Notes:
           use physical URLs, since we don't have a web server running
           I have already created a skeletal version of juicers.xml for you

2. Create juicers.xsd

3. Create juicer.xsd

Use the schema from Lab10 as your starting point.

I have provided XLink.xsd for you in this folder.  You can use it. 

Validate each juicer document, and juicers.xml
