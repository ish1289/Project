    <description>There&apos;s just no substitute for a properly squeezed orange in the morning. So delicate and refreshing. The finest hotels use mechanical juicers of this type for their most discriminating guests. This is the largest selling juicer of its kind. It&apos;s a beautiful little all-metal piece in baked enamel and polished chrome; it even won the Frankfurt Fair Award for its design. Uses no electricity and produces no non-recyclable waste as do frozen juices.</description>
