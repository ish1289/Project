Lab 9. Elements in Any Order

There is no inherent reason that the children of the 
juicer element should occur in a specified 
order.  Let's change the schema so that the
juicer element contains the same set of child elements
but allow them to occur in any order.  Once you've
done that, shuffle the elements around in
juicers.xml.  As always, validate the instance document 
against your schema.

Notes: 

[1] Whenever a type extends a base type, the
extension elements are always appended to the 
base type's elements:

b1, b2, e1, e2

where b1 and b2 are the base type's elements and
e1, e2 are the elements from the type that is 
extending the base type.  

Thus, even if you make the base type unordered and
the type extending the base type unordered, the
resulting set of elements will still be partially ordered:

{b1, b2}, {e1, e2}

where the curly braces indicates an unordered set.  
We have an unordered first set followed (sequentially)
by an unordered second set.

So, for this lab you are to delete the appliance type
and place its element declarations in with the 
juiceAppliance type.

[2] One of the restrictions on using the <all> element
is that the elements declared within <all> must have a maxOccurs="1".
So, remove the cost that specifies the cost in Canadian Dollars.
(We will just deal in US currency.)
