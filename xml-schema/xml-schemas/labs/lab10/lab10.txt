Lab 10. Using Empty

Revert back to the schema that you created in lab 8.c
(where you had an appliance complexType).

Currently the retailer element has as its
content a URI.  Modify it so that its
content is empty and it instead has an
attribute - href - whose type is anyURI.
Once you've done that, modify juicers.xml
to reflect this change. As always, validate 
the instance document against your schema.
