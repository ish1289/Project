Lab 3. Using the Built-in Datatypes

For this lab you are to rework the juicers.xsd
that you created in Lab 2.  You are to change the
datatypes from string to another built-in datatype,
where it makes sense.  Hint: weight, cost, and
retailer can be declared with a much more relevant
datatype than string.  As always, validate the instance 
document against your schema.
