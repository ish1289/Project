Lab 11.a Creating an Appliances Repository Schema

For this lab you are to modify the juicers.xml and juicers.xsd
that you created in the last lab (lab 10).

In all of the labs thus far we have stored all of our
schema components in a single schema.  Typically, however,
you will put elements/types that may be used by
many schemas into its own schema (a repository schema).
In our juicer example the appliance type is an example of 
something that could be used in many schemas.  Hence, let's 
pull it out of juicers.xsd and put it into a generic schema, 
appliances.xsd.  Then modify juicers.xsd to use the definition 
of appliances in appliances.xsd.  For this lab you are to use
the same namespace for the two schemas.
