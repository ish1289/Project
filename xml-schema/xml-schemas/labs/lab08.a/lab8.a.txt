Lab 8.a Using Attributes

In this directory you will find a version of juicers.xml
which uses attributes.  I have included juicers.dtd to 
show how the attributes were declared.  Modify the schema 
that you created in Lab 7 to incorporate these attributes. 
As always, validate the instance document against your schema.
