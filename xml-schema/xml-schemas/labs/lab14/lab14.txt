Lab 14. Creating a Schema for your Home Appliances, Version 2

After completing lab 13 you may have felt dissatisfied with
the end result.  Let's consider its deficiencies:

[1] We made the element appliance of type a:appliance.  Thus,
    in the instance document one of our home appliances could
    have been an appliance.  appliance really represents a class
    of things, and should never be an instance.  The instances
    should be juiceAppliance, stereoAppliance, etc.  (Analogously,
    it wouldn't make sense to allow an instance called person.
    Instead, the instances should be Roger, Sally, Pete, etc.)

[2] Instead of writing our instance document as:

       <homeAppliances>
           <appliance xsi:type="j:juiceApplicance">
              ...
           </appliance>
           <appliance xsi:type="stereoApplicance">
              ...
           </appliance>
       </homeAppliances>

It would be much more readable if we could write it as:

       <homeAppliances>
           <juicer>
              ...
           </juicer>
           <stereo>
              ...
           </stereo>
        </homeAppliances> 

Modify your work from lab 13 so that it no longer has these deficiencies.

As always, validate the instance document against your schema.
