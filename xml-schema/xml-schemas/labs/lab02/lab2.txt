Lab 2. Using Embedded Element Declarations

For this lab you are to rework the juicers schema
that you created in lab 1.
You are to make it more compact.  That is,
rather than declaring an element and then ref'ing
it, you are to inline the actual element declaration. 
Validate the instance document against your schema.
