Lab 8.c Using Attributes (concluded)

I have further enhanced juicers.xml and juicers.dtd to have 
a units attribute for weight. Modify the schema that you 
created in Lab 8.b to incorporate this attribute. As always, 
validate the instance document against your schema.

Hint:

    You can specify an attribute to have a fixed value as follows:
  
     <attribute name="speed" type="positiveInteger" fixed="200"/>
