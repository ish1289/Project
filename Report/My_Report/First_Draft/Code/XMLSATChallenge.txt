    <challengeDescription>
      <description>The SAT Challenge 2012 is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
      It is organized as a satellite event to the Fifteenth International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2012) and stands in the tradition of the SAT Competitions that have been held yearly from 2002 to 2005 and biannually starting from 2007, and the SAT-Races held in 2006, 2008 and 2010.

      <description>
        Assessment of solvers will be based on the number of successfully handled instances and the time needed to solve them. Solvers will be assessed based on the number of instances solved within the run-time limit. If several solvers successfully process the same number of instances, as a second criterion, the cumulated run-time (CPU time for sequential solvers,
        wall-clock time for parallel solvers) of all solved instances is used to rank the solvers

          The benchmark pool will include instances from previous SAT-Races and SAT Competitions, but may also contain additional instances.
          Note that you will not receive an automated acknowledgement of your submission, 
          as the benchmarks are added to the EDACC system manually. Your benchmark set will appear in the "List of submitted benchmarks" when it is added to the system.
        </description>
        <format>Submission of archive with your benchmarks is through the web form. 
        Please make sure to select the correct category, and to include the PDF file with the description of the benchmarks in the archive</format>

        <inputRequirement>
          In order to obtain reproducible results, SAT solvers should refrain from using non-deterministic
          program constructs as far as possible.
          It is allowed to set a random seed value on the command line, however.
